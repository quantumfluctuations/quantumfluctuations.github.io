    <font>A Brief Timeline of his Life:</font>
    <ul id= "tribute-info">
      <li>8/8/1902:Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac was born to Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac(Father) and Florence Hannah Dirac(Mother) at Bristol,England</li><br>
      <li>Dirac was first educated at Bishop Road Primary School and later at  Merchant Venturers' Technical College where his father used to teach French. They usually laid emphasis on technical activities like shoemaking,metallurgy,etc.</li><br>
      <li>Dirac studied electrical engineering at the University of Bristol's engineering faculty on a scholarship.</li><br>
      <li>1923:Dirac gratuated with first-class honours and received a £140 scholarship from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.Due to various scholarships received by him,he could finally settle in Cambridge.</li><br>
      <li>There he pursued his intrests in the Theory of Relativity under the supervision of Ralph Fowler</li><br>
      <li>June 1926:Dirac completed his PhD by publishing the first thesis on quantum machanics</li><br>
      <li>He continued his research at Copenhagen and Göttingen</li><br>
      <li>1937:Dirac married Margit Wigner.He adopted Margit's two children and they together had two children</li><br>
      <li>Paul's father insisted that his children spoke to him in French(as he was a French teacher and an immigrant from Switzerland). But he could not express himself in French.Thus he decided to remain silent. This was one of the many reasons for his modest and silent character</li><br>
      <li>1984:Paul Dirac was pronounced dead at Tallahassee,Florida.</li><br>
      <font>Contributions to the Field of Physics</font><br><br>
      <li>Quantification of the Gravitational Field</li><br>
      <li>The Dirac Equation</li><br>
      <li>Fermi-Dirac Statistics</li><br>
      <li>Proposed the existence of Magnetic Monopole</li><br>
      <li>Homi.J.Bhabha(father of the Indian Nuclear Program)was a student of his.</li><br>
      <font>Accolades and Awards</font><br><br>
      <li>1930: Elected fellow of the Royal Society</li><br>
     <li>1933: Nobel Prize (with Erwin Schrödinger)</li><br>
      <li>1939: The Royal Medal</li><br>
      <li>1948: Honorary Fellow of the American Physical Society</li><br>
      <li>1952: The Copley and Max Planck Medal</li><br>
      <li>1969: J.Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize</li> <br>     
      <li>1971: Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London</li><br>
      <li>1973: Order of Merit</li><br>
